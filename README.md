# scVAG: Unified Single-Cell Clustering via Variational-Autoencoder Integration with Graph Attention Autoencoder

<p style="text-align: justify;">
scVAG is an innovative framework that integrates Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and Graph Attention Autoencoder (GATE) models for enhanced analysis of single-cell gene expression data. Built upon the scGAC architecture, scVAG replaces linear PCA with nonlinear dimensionality reduction to improve clustering performance. Through comparative evaluation on 14 datasets, scVAG demonstrates greater robustness and clustering precision compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

## Usage

### Preprocessing
<p style="text-align: justify;">

When using the `preprocess.py` script for data preprocessing, it is crucial to specify the address of your dataset. The dataset file must be named `ori_data.tsv` for the preprocessing script to function correctly. Below is an example command illustrating how to execute the preprocessing script:
<p>

```bash
python preprocess.py Chung
```
After preprocessing, a file named `data.tsv` is generated to store the processed data. This file serves as input for both the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and the graph construction stages in the scVAG pipeline.

### Run VAE

For VAE to work, you must specify the address of the dataset. for example,

```bash
python scVAG_VAE.py Chung
```
The `vae.csv` file is stored within the dataset folder, capturing the intermediate output from the initial VAE encoding phase. This file stores the latent representation extracted by the Variational Autoencoder, crucial for subsequent stages.

### Run GATE (scGAC)
<p style="text-align: justify;">
As our scVAG pipeline builds upon the scGAC framework, we adopt their open-sourced codebase for executing the graph attention autoencoder and network enhancement phases. This enables direct benchmarking against the baseline architecture while allowing us to focus enhancements on the novel VAE integration and evaluation. Specifically, the GATE and NE modules are configured using the original scGAC parameters of input dataset address and number of clusters. By reusing optimized scaffolding code, we can directly validate improvements arising from our VAE augmentation and comparative analysis.
<p>

For GATE section to work, you must specify the address of the dataset and the number of clusters. for example,

```bash
python scGAC.py Chung 5
```
The /results folder contains text files with the predicted clustering outputs for each dataset. The files follow the naming convention pred_<dataset_name>.txt - for example, the predicted clusters for the mouse_brain dataset are in pred_mouse_brain.txt. These files allow examination of the specific cluster assignments predicted by the model across different datasets.

## Results
### Clustering Performance

We evaluated the performance of the scVAG model on a diverse set of single-cell datasets, ranging from humans to mice. The clustering accuracy was assessed using two widely recognized metrics: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).


#### ARI Comparison

Figure 1 illustrates the ARI comparison between scVAG and five other single-cell clustering baselines across 14 datasets. Each subplot represents a specific dataset, while the last subplot presents the average ARI across all datasets.

![Sample Image1](images/ARI%20diagram.svg)
*Figure 1: This is a sample image.*

##### Observations

- scVAG consistently outperformed other baselines in 10 out of 14 datasets.
- The average ARI across all datasets demonstrates the superior clustering accuracy achieved by scVAG.

#### NMI Comparison

Figure 2 provides a similar comparison as in Figure 1, but using the Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) metric.

##### Insights

- scVAG consistently exhibits higher NMI values across various datasets.
- The average NMI reinforces scVAG's effectiveness in capturing meaningful clusters.
